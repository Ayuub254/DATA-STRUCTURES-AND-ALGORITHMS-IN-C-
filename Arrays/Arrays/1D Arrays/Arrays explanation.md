#  BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ARRAY IN C++
    
    The code above is a basic implementation of an array in c++. It has the following
    functionalities:
    1. Insertion into the array
    2. Displaying of the items in the array.
    3. Searching for an element in the array.
    
    The above codebase has been written using OOP principles, whereby the functionalites
    insertion, displaying, and searching of the items of the array have been wriiten in
    separate methods.
    
    NB: The array that has been implemented is a static array and therefore has 
    a fixed size of 4 elements.
